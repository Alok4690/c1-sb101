Question:Why String is immutable in java and what is the difference between String and String Builder? And Write some
          of the methods of String class at least 5 with example.

sol: The String is immutable in Java because of the security, synchronization and concurrency, caching, and class loading. 
     The reason of making string final is to destroy the immutability and to not allow others to extend it.
     
   1>  A String is immutable in Java, while a StringBuilder is mutable in Java.
   2>The String class implements the Comparable interface, while StringBuilder doesn’t.
   3>We can create a String object without using a new operator, which is not possible with a StringBuilder.
   
   Method of String----
   
   1>concat(): Appends a string to the end of another string.
   2>compareTo(): Compares two strings lexicographically
   3>charAt() : Returns the character at the specified index (position)
   4>length() : Returns the length of a specified string
   5>isEmpty() : Checks whether a string is empty or not
